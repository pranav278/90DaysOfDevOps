# üêß What is Linux?

**Linux** is an open-source operating system kernel forming the basis for several Unix-like OSs. Pioneered by Linus Torvalds in 1991, it's now a global OS powerhouse.

## üåü Why is Linux OS So Famous?

- **Open-Source Brilliance:** Linux's source code is open to all, enabling devs to learn, tweak, and share as they wish.
- **Software Diversity:** From web servers, DBs, programming languages to multimedia tools, Linux supports a plethora.
- **Community Spirit:** A vast and lively Linux community exists for knowledge-sharing, problem-solving, and collaboration.
- **Free Spirit:** Typically, Linux is free, slashing licensing costs and boosting resource efficiency.
- **Fort Knox Security:** A potent security matrix, coupled with open-source, ensures swift vulnerability resolutions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Linux Architecture

The Linux architecture seamlessly integrates elements such as:

- **Hardware Layer:** Housing devices like CPU, HDD, and RAM.
  
- **Kernel:** A core OS component, the kernel controls primary Linux functions. It communicates directly with hardware, abstracting trivial hardware/software specifics. Kernel types include:
  - Monolithic Kernel
  - Micro Kernels
  - Exo Kernels
  - Hybrid Kernels
  
- **System Libraries:** These OS-implemented functions bypass kernel code access rights.

- **System Utility Programs:** Designed for specific, individual tasks.
  
- **Shell:** Spanning graphical and command-line shells, it acts as the kernel-user liaison. It dispenses kernel services and drives kernel actions.

## üìú Basic Linux Commands

- **List Files:** `ls`
- **Change Directory:** `cd`
- **Create File:** `touch "filename"`
- **Copy File:** `cp Source Destination`
- **Remove File:** `rm filename`
- **Add User:** `sudo useradd name`
- **Remove User:** `userdel -r username`
- **Current Directory:** `pwd`
- **View File Content:** `cat`

## ‚ùì Difference Between Update and Upgrade?

While `update` merely fetches info about the latest package versions, it's the `apt upgrade` that actively downloads and elevates the package to its newest avatar.
